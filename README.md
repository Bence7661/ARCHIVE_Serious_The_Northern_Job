# The Northern Job
V1.0.0  

You're a seasoned stalker. You've disabled the **Miracle Machine** fought off the Monolith at the barrier and turned off the **Brain Scorcher**.  
When you're adventuring on the North you don't give the slightest care in the world about stuff that needs to be done South, so why should anyone bother you with Southern concerns?  

This mod checks if you're on a Northern map looking for a job. If you're then it will filter out all tasks that would send you down South. You've spent enough time there fixing it. Now you've got more pressing matters elsewhere.

## Tasks included
All vanilla anomaly tasks are accounted for (in theory) with 1 exception
- Bounty
  - Capture Enemy Documents
- Spy extraction
- Assault
- Delivery
- Fate/Lost Signal
- Anomaly measurement?!
  
The exception: Guide tasks.  
When you're North and the game rolls you a guide task it will be North location -> North location.  
Only Red Forest has guide tasks that can send you South, but I decided to not filter those since then they would basically disappear forever from the task pool.

iTheon's tasks:
- Stolen specimen
- Shakedown
- Blood Stained Coin

## Installation
If you have **The Job Can Wait** installed make sure that you install this with higher priority, so if **The Job Can Wait** has prio of 1 this mod should have a priority of 2.
Otherwise just drop it at max prio.

## Compatibility
Manual patching needed
- New levels 0.53 (2023.07.25): Patch can be found in `gamedata\compatibility_patches\New_Levels_0.53`. There is a `README.txt` with instructions on how to apply (You just need to drag and drop 1 file no biggie).
